# otx-ioc-exporter

A single-file browser tool to fetch, filter, and export Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from your subscribed [AlienVault OTX](https://otx.alienvault.com) threat intelligence pulses — no backend, no install, no dependencies.

---

## What It Does

Connects directly to the OTX API using your personal API key and pulls IOC data from your subscribed pulses. All processing happens in your browser. Results are displayed in a resizable, filterable table and can be exported to CSV or JSON for SIEM ingestion, blocklist creation, or further analysis.

---

## Features

- **On-demand pulse pagination** — loads 50 pulses per page (OTX max per call). Pages 1–10 are available as manual buttons; each page is fetched only when you click it and cached for the session
- **Resizable columns** — drag any column border to resize, Excel-style. The table scrolls horizontally so no data is ever hidden
- **Full IOC details per row** — Date, IOC Value, Type, Pulse name, Author, TLP classification, Tags, and a direct clickable link to the source OTX pulse
- **Filter controls** — filter by IOC type (IPv4, domain, file hash, URL, email, etc.), TLP level (WHITE / GREEN / AMBER / RED), or free-text search across IOC value and pulse name
- **Color-coded badges** — IOC types and TLP levels are visually distinguished at a glance
- **Export to CSV** — includes Date, IOC Value, Type, Pulse, Pulse URL, Author, TLP, Tags, Created (full timestamp), and Description
- **Export to JSON** — full structured data for each IOC including pulse URL, suitable for scripting or pipeline ingestion
- **Stats bar** — shows total IOC count, pulse count, distinct IOC types, and distinct authors across all loaded pages
- **No install required** — open the `.html` file directly in Chrome or Firefox

## How to Use

### 1. Handle CORS

Because this tool runs as a local file in your browser, the OTX API will block requests by default due to browser CORS policy. You need a CORS-unblocking extension — this takes about 60 seconds to set up.

Install one of the following:

| Browser | Extension |
|---|---|
| Chrome | [CORS Unblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino) |
| Chrome | [Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf) |
| Firefox | [CORS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/) |

> ⚠ **Security note:** These extensions disable your browser's same-origin protection globally. Enable only while using this tool. Toggle off immediately after.

### 2. Get Your OTX API Key

1. Go to [https://otx.alienvault.com/api](https://otx.alienvault.com/api)
2. Copy your personal API key from the **"Your API Key"** section

### 3. Fetch IOCs

1. Open `otx-ioc-exporter.html` in Chrome or Firefox
2. Enable your CORS extension
3. Paste your API key into the input field
4. Click **Fetch IOCs** — pulse page 1 loads immediately (up to 50 pulses)

### 4. Load More Pulse Pages

After the initial load, a **Pulse Pages** navigation bar appears (buttons 1–10). Each button represents the next 50 pulses from OTX. Click any page number to fetch that batch on demand. Already-loaded pages are highlighted and served from cache — no repeat API calls.

### 5. Filter and Search

Use the controls above the table to narrow results:
- **All Types** dropdown — filter by IOC type (IPv4, DOMAIN, URL, FILEHASH-MD5, etc.)
- **All TLP** dropdown — filter by TLP classification
- **Search box** — searches across IOC value and pulse name in real time

### 6. Export

- **Export CSV** — downloads all currently filtered IOCs as a `.csv` file, ready for Excel, Splunk, Elastic, or any SIEM
- **Export JSON** — downloads all currently filtered IOCs as a structured `.json` file

> Exports reflect the active filters. To export everything, clear all filters before exporting.

## File Naming

Suggested repository name: **`otx-ioc-exporter`**

Suggested file name: **`otx-ioc-exporter.html`**

---

## Use Cases

- SOC analysts pulling fresh IOCs from subscribed threat feeds for daily triage
- Exporting IOC lists to ingest into Elastic Security, Splunk, or Microsoft Sentinel detection rules
- Building blocklists (IP, domain, hash) for EDR or firewall policies
- Cross-referencing MITRE ATT&CK-tagged pulses during incident response
- Quickly pivoting to source pulse context via the OTX Pulse link during investigation

---

## Limitations

- Requires a CORS browser extension to function (browser security restriction on local files)
- Fetches up to 500 pulses per session (10 pages × 50 pulses). For larger OTX subscriptions, use the OTX Python SDK or DirectConnect API
- No authentication storage — API key is not saved between sessions
- Internet connection required (calls OTX API live)
